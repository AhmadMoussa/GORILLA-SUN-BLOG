<i>This blog post serves as submission to <a href='https://twitter.com/sableRaph'>RaphaÃ«l de Courville</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge! You might ask:  'Where is the code?', and well, this week's topic was 'Non-computer' so I stepped away from the keyboard for a bit and did something a little different!</i>
</div>

For this challenge I channeled my inner child and glue gunned together these little 'constructs'. Made from scrap I ramsacked from the garage, and some stuff I found in the garden. I'm not going to lie, but it was a lot of fun making these!

<div class="image fit" style="display: block; margin: 0 0 0 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
  <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" style="width:100%; border-radius: 0.375em; margin: 0 0 0 0;" draggable="true">

<h2>Initial Idea: Stop Motion</h2>

<p>Initially I wanted to make a stop motion video. It sounded like a fun idea, so I set up my camera in a corner of the room and had a desk lamp light the surface that I was filming. Then I edited and cut out all the parts where my hands were showing, see result: </p>

<div class="image fit" style="display: block; margin: 0 0 0 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
  <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" style="width:100%; border-radius: 0.375em; margin: 0 0 0 0;" draggable="true">
    <source src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/noncomputer/output.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>	
</div>

<p></p>

<p>Stop motion turns out to be quite difficult to record and edit! (I really don't have the patience for editing:P). But I'm certainly going to attempt this idea again at some point in the future (after thinking through my set up a little more).</p>

<h2><a name='process'></a>Process</h2>
Here are some pics from the process that I screen grabbed from the videos. They have a certain cozy feel to them. Otherwise there isn't much to document here, you basically put some glue on something and then stick another thing onto it and hold it for a couple of seconds.

<div class="row gtr-50">
	<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
			<img src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/noncomputer/2.png" alt="">

	</div>

<h2><a name='constructs'></a>Constructs</h2>

Here are the two 'chestnut men' that I came up with. I really like the look of the filaments of the glue, hence I didn't remove it. Gives it sort of a wild look:

<div class="row gtr-50">
	<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
		<div class="image fit" style="display: block; margin: 0 0 0 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
		  <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" style="width:100%; border-radius: 0.375em; margin: 0 0 0 0;" draggable="true">
		    <source src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/noncomputer/creature1safe.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		  </video>	
		</div>
	</div>

And that's a wrap, hope you enjoyed! Honk Honk!
