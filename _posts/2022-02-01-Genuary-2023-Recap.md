Genuary has been an absolute whirlwind tour-de-force of a month! You might've already seen some posts on social media with the #genuary hashtags, have had a crack at some of the prompts or even made it through all of the daily prompts (in that case I salute you!). Genuary is a month long event where creative coders come together, roll up their sleeves and code up sketches in response to a daily prompt. In a sense, Genuary is the generative art world's answer to inktober. It's only been the 3rd Genuary so far, and overall my second time participating, but it already felt much bigger than it did last year, just from the amount of people that participated this time around!

We also saw two attempts at speedrunning all Genuary prompts in one sitting, first by <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1708134020'>Raph</a> and later also by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyGG15J9bAc'>Daniel Schiffman</a> from the coding train. The current record stands at roughly 3 hours and 45 minutes, but that might change soon!

Another big thing this Genuary was #GenuaryTogether, an initiative by Raph where prompts become a group effort and can be approached as collaborative pieces. Here's the first sketch in that regard by <a href='https://twitter.com/sableRaph'>Raph</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/MAKIO135'>Lionel Raddison</a>:

I tried my best to get a sketch in for the daily Genuary prompts, but the daily-ness of this sketching routine quickly fell apart at some point as there were some other things that I had to take care of. But that‚Äôs just life! Not gonna beat myself up about it, I ultimately managed to catch up, and overall I‚Äôm really happy with all of the sketches that I came up with, some of which I think I'll dig into more throughout the coming weeks. Sometimes the best way to go about creative coding is while being on a time crunch, that‚Äôs when the best ideas happen and you really tap into that hidden creativity compartment at the back of your head!

Here‚Äôs a rundown of my Genuary sketches alongside some commentary about the idea and inspiration for each one of them as well as some thoughts on the code that went into their making! I'll also round up my favorite sketches, at least the ones that I've seen in my feed, there have been some absolute bangers!

<h2><a name='1'></a>#1 Infinite Loop</h2>

For the very first prompt I wanted to make an animation I had already been thinking about for weeks at that point. It was a bit of an exploration until I figured out how to put it together. The initial inspiration was this infinite Mondrian loop by Feliks Tomasz that I found on giphy:

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3og0IROkdNyWyCG2I0" width="100%" height="300" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
<p></p>

I believe it was even minted as a token in the early HEN days! However, after some initial attempts, I couldn‚Äôt really figure out how to recreate this infinitely looping spiral. After searching a little more I came across another animation that I thought to be a bit more approachable:

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HriEPuKHAf0BsirCCY" width="100%" height="300" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
<p></p>

You might already have a hunch on what's going on here! Essentially, the ratio at which the squares are expanding here is better known as the ‚Äògolden ratio‚Äô (a very popular ratio in creative coding as well). This ratio also describes the Fibonacci sequence, where each element in the sequence is the sum of the two previous elements. Dividing an arbitrary element in this sequence by its immediate predecessor yields this golden ratio. Now, when visualising this with squares you might say that the third square is clearly larger than the sum of the two previous squares! And visually that is true, but you have to keep in mind that we‚Äôre not representing the area, but rather the length of the sides.

In my first attempt I focused on recreating only one of the four quadrants of the animation, since the other 3 are just rotated mirror images. I quickly realised though that it wasn‚Äôt as straightforward as I had initially thought, I did get something going that looked pretty close, but it wasn‚Äôt really a Fibonacci sequence, just some expanding lines:

<iframe src="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1821818/embed/?plusEmbedHash=NjU4YWYxYWI5NTZlODhjYjg0MGMwZmNkYzA5ZWI3OTJkZjhiMTc4YjhjNmUzOWMxMWY3ODZkMjIyZmQ4YjA4NWQ3MTE0ZGNjZTQ5ODNlMjgzMDE4YmUwN2VmNGU0YzU5YzYyNjc1NDJhODU1YTJkMTNlMWU4MWRkYjU0OWFkMzlNRkZ6TTNCbDV2Rlc5TUhwNWhkZVR1MGRFR2FOQXhBVVA3SEo2M2NFK3VHVk80TXBLMXo0TTF0RFlrcndHVEY5N2U4OXdINHkzNWt6RDQ1dEtxeXN4QT09&plusEmbedTitle=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
<p></p>

I returned to a sketch that I had done just a couple of days prior to that, that actually made use of the Fibonacci formula to obtain the size of the squares. Positioning the squares in that distinct manner can be done with two parameters and a couple of if conditions that keep track of things. Now to the hard part: animating this thing somehow.

The majority of examples for the Fibonacci sequence start with the two initial values 0 and 1, but it isn‚Äôt necessary to start with these two numbers, in fact you can start with any two arbitrary numbers. For example, 0 and a very small number like 1e-4, and we‚Äôd still end up with a valid Fibonacci sequence if we keep adding them up. Using the same code to draw out these fibonacci tiles, we initially get many small rectangles, so small in fact that they‚Äôre practically invisible on the canvas.

To animate this, we can now simply increment the starting values of the sequence, redraw the squares and export the frame to later compile into a GIF. But there are two problems here: firstly, at which rate do these starting numbers need to be incremented for a visually constant and smooth expansion of the Fibonacci tiles? And secondly at what point do the squares line up again? The second part is important for resetting the animation and making it seamlessly loop.

And I still haven‚Äôt found the answer to either one of these questions‚Ä¶ I ended up cheating a little bit, trying out different numbers and manually checking where the animation lines up again. When the rate of expansion is slow enough it is virtually smooth. That‚Äôs also why the animation speeds up a little bit towards the end and then slows down again, I didn't actually mind it too much, thought it kinda looked like an easing function.

<h2><a name='2'></a>#2 Made in 10 mins</h2>

Numerically this was my most successful genuary tweet! I just felt really good that day, and I already had a vague idea of what I wanted to make, basically a remix of these grid SDFs that I had already done countless times before and thought that it could be fun to make a timelapse of me coding it up. I guess, in a way, it is fascinating to see the code come together while observing how many times I scratch my chin during the process.

As for the code, I'll talk a bit more about that in <>#8 SDF since it's pretty much the same concept. Definitely planning on doing more like this in the future!

<a href='https://twitter.com/smrghsh'>Samir</a> felt inspired by my tweet and also did a timelapse, where we can see that holding your chin is a viable strat for algorithmic problem solving:

<h2><a name='3'></a>#3 Glitch Art</h2>

Never tried to make glitch art before, initially I wanted to have a stab at a pixel sorting Algorithm but didn‚Äôt end up having enough time. In this sketch I‚Äôm reusing my <a href='https://gorillasun.de/blog/an-algorithm-for-irregular-grids'>irregular grid algo</a> from a couple of months back, with the additional twist that it‚Äôs animated and not just a static piece. Looking at the formal definition for what a glitch is, I tried to approach the prompt from a little bit of a different angle:

<blockquote>Glitch: a sudden, usually temporary malfunction or fault of equipment.</blockquote>

The idea was to create some sort of machine, whose components are slowly breaking apart until complete failure is reached. Each cell in the grid holds it‚Äôs own counter that has a random chance of being incremented every frame, which is represented by a blinking 404 Error message. Once this counter reaches a specific threshold the cell turns red and can be considered defect. The overall counter (the red bar at the bottom) is made up out of the sum of all of those individual counters.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Glitch Art ‚ÅâÔ∏è<br><br>glitch: a sudden, usually temporary malfunction or fault of equipment <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#genuary</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#genuary3</a> <a href="https://t.co/qgi7XKOZ4B">pic.twitter.com/qgi7XKOZ4B</a></p>&mdash; Ahmad Moussa || Gorilla Sun (@gorillasu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gorillasu/status/1610406884556656642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2><a name='4'></a>#4 Intersections</h2>

My initial idea for this were just some intersection lines that are looping between two coordinates on the canvas, coloring the lines whenever they intersect each other:

<iframe src="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1821848/embed/?plusEmbedHash=ZTQ3ZTJiNDI2MTMyOGFlMTUzNDc2NTg5ZWM5MTkyMjZjZWY5MzMzNDYxZGNiMzM5NDRkNTViYTg3MjllODI3OTI1NTc5NWViMTA4NjcxYjMwZGIzODQ4MGI3NTI3ZTIxN2JlODQ1OGE3YjRjZjM3NTQ5MDAzNTMxYTFiYjMyYjZCYkFYZEhRRGxpR0w2WW9vb2ZYUFRpaHNlQ0dONW5ueWp2bnJLOVZ3T2s4cDNLM0d4YXNJd0tYNXlsN2tGN1BRSnFLWTBlSW43VzZBRUNheGxseG4zUT09&plusEmbedTitle=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe>
<p></p>

This didn't look like much hence I decided to go a different route with something more geometric. I ended up with something that looked more like futuristic bookshelves.

There were so many stunning sketches for this prompt, ultimately making my ideas feel a little uninspired in comparison. Two favourites here were by <a href='https://twitter.com/elliotschultz'>Elliot Schultz</a>:

Another contender here is <a href='https://twitter.com/_danlever'>Daniel Lever</a>. If you have a closer look at his Twitter timeline, once a year Daniel he awakens from a long slumber to unleash a generative box of Pandora full of stunning sketches.

<h2><a name='6'></a>#6 Steal like an artist</h2>

I'm a huge fan of Dave Pagurek‚Äôs interpolated hand-drawn SVG sketches, where one drawing morphs into another one. Have a look at this goose morphing into an angry goose!

I think it's just a really smart and relatively straight-forward way to animate things, without actually having to go through the process of animating. Adding a slight sinusoidal wobble to the strokes gives it an even more cartoony character:

<blockquote>There's a few steps involved with this one, but it involves: (1) importing drawings as SVGs, (2) drawing the SVGs with offsets to make it wiggle, (3) interpolating between paths in different drawings</blockquote>

Technically, any path can morph into another given that they have the same number of vertices, which was the idea behind my sketch. I generated a couple of numbers based on coordinates in a grid, which I manually typed out in an array and then interpolated between, creating this generative counter:

<h2><a name='7'></a>#7 Sample a cooler palette from your favourite movie/album cover</h2>

I was excited for this prompt at first but then felt really uninspired when it actually came to making something for it. Ideally I would have coded up some sort of color sampling algo, like k-means clustering, but decided that that was too much work and wouldn't really net me a graphic that I could later share. I decided to go back and reuse some code inspired by <a href='https://github.com/ronikaufman/poetical_computer_vision'>Roni Kaufman's poetical computer vision project</a>:

<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
  <img class="viewable" src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/GENUARY2023/JPEGS/shihiro.jpg" alt="">
</span>
<p></p>

In that manner the algo samples colors from the underlying image to alter it's style and make it appear as if it were drawn by many brush strokes. The brush strokes themself are composited from many short lines of varying thickness.


<h2><a name='8'></a>#8 SDF</h2>

For this one I already knew what I wanted to do, playing more with grids and sinusoidal movement similarly to what I did on the second genuary prompt, as well as many previous sketches. A little tutorial on this can be found <a href='https://gorillasun.de/blog/making-of-gzork'>here</a>.

Mid-November of the past year I was playing again with these SDFs, and had a little bit of a lightbulb moment when I made the realisation that the distance of the points in the grid don‚Äôt necessarily only need to be measured with respect to another single point, but can also be measured with respect to an entire polygon positioned somewhere on the canvas. You still have find a formula for measuring this distance correctly but in that manner very interesting patterns can emerge. For example, here is an SDF where the size and colour of the points in the grid is modulated with respect to their distance to a rotating line positioned at the centre (for clarity's sake the line is drawn out here in red):

<iframe src="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1822987/embed/?plusEmbedHash=M2M0MTdmYjIyZWMyNTgyZDg3NDlhYWIxY2Y2YzgxNzU0ODdmOTVhZjNmZDNiZDQzYzBlOTdmN2UzMGFmNDQyOTFiN2E1N2IwZGRkZWVlOWVhNTAyYWQ0Y2NiYjMzYzE4ZDgxZWQ3OTZlMGE0Yjg1NWIzNDhiZDcwYzI2MWMzYTV4bWNFL0g2OEpWOHVKakdDbkpTQldzekFDNlMwc3lrR3RKS2M0RFVqSnE2Qmh0YVFsSWhqSTFnRnp4cyt2N3BxRTJpOFlRbkRNbEtWTWxDdGRHVS8zQT09&plusEmbedTitle=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe>
<p></p>

Additionally, you can also combine different distance functions, or place multiple items in the scene and see which one is closest! In my genuary sketch I am drawing three lines going outwards from the center and measuring the minimum distance towrads them, obtaining a sort of rotating peace sign:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Signed Distance Function <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#genuary</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary8?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#genuary8</a> <a href="https://t.co/ywdzmG495M">pic.twitter.com/ywdzmG495M</a></p>&mdash; Ahmad Moussa || Gorilla Sun (@gorillasu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gorillasu/status/1612469603980152835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></p>

I think that this one was the prompt that people were afraid of the most, since SDFs are usually associated with shaders. But Piter Pasma to the rescue, he put together a super informative tutorial about the topic on the tubes!

I liked this one so much I had to ask how it was made, assuming that it might use an underlying picture for flowers, similarly to what I did for genuary #7, and I believe that the ultimate texture is achieved in this manner. Elsif reveals though that is completely generative by first generating a field of geometric flowers, the same motif that they used for genuary #3:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hi, thank you! it&#39;s fully generative <a href="https://t.co/sp3QQ4NT75">pic.twitter.com/sp3QQ4NT75</a></p>&mdash; elsif (@ElsifThen) <a href="https://twitter.com/ElsifThen/status/1621574762182111232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I believe that the resulting texture is still achieved by applying an intermediary pixel sort as well as orienting the direction of the lines with a Perlin noise flow.

<h2><a name='10'></a>#10 Generative Music</h2>

I generally feel like more sketches should have sound accompanying them, especially animations. This one I've also thought about before, wondering what it would sound like if the collisions between rectangles produced a sound. There's a lot of playroom here, choice of musical scale, what rectangles produce what sound, tying velocity of the note to the force of impact, etc... I just did a simple thing however, adding a little bit of reverb and delay in ableton live makes it sound quite ephemeral:

<h2><a name='11'></a>#11 Suprematism</h2>

Positioning plays an incredibly important role in Suprematist compositions; to me these compositions often evoke a sentiment of fleetingness and ephemerality, as if we were only gazing upon a brief slice of a larger geometric movement.

During the making-of my fxhash token <a href='https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/making-of-neo-supremus'>Neo-Supremus</a> I learned a lot about trying to imitate a natural positioning of these kinds of geometric elements, and I was surprised how quickly the code came together for the gentry sketch. It‚Äôs been a minute since I looked at the code for Neo-supremus but I guess all the agonising over positioning strategies did have a lasting effect. You can read more about how the token was made <a href='https://gorillasun.de/blog/making-of-neo-supremus'>here</a>.

<a href='https://twitter.com/AnaPetArt'>Anapet</a>'s sketch really stood out to me here:

<h2><a name='12'></a>#12 Tesselation</h2>

Generally, a tessellation is the subdivision of a 2 dimensional space with geometric shapes and forms (in that context better referred to as tiles) such that there are no gaps or overlaps between these tiles. I've done a lot of sketches that are based on this, and decided to return to one of my favourite geometric shapes, the hexagon:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">

		</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p></p>

And the patterns that can emerge in this manner are truly endless. A sketch that I really enjoyed here was by <a href='https://twitter.com/JulienLabat'>Julien Labat</a>, which is also based on a hexagonal tiling, with the additional twist that they're Truchet tiles, generating a infinitely interlacing connectedness:

<h2><a name='13'></a>#13 Something you‚Äôve always wanted to learn</h2>

Always wanted to do more with text, especially after seeing Roni Kaufman‚Äôs overarching Genuary theme. One thing I‚Äôve always found annoying working with text in p5 is how hard it is to precisely position it. For this reason I took a little dip into opentype.js that makes this much easier by giving you access to the bounding box of the text, and hence making positioning much easier. Additional it gives you access to the vertices of the strokes that make up the letters, at various granularities, which is what I used to make the letters wiggle erratically back and forth:

<h2><a name='14'></a>#14 Aesemic</h2>

The term <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing'>Asemic</a></b> is used to describe characters, lines and symbols that deceive the eye by having semblance to human writing but are ultimately devoid of any semantic meaning. I discovered that this actually is a very popular art direction and a lot of works have been made in that regard.

My sketch for this prompt made use of a grid where the coordinates are slightly displaced and then connected with Bezier curves. There's also a random chance to end the current row as well as skip a line:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

I really loved Piter's sketch here, instead of faking it the way I did, he attempts at simulating the actual wrist movements that go into human hand-writing. This is actually non-trivial, and he elaborates a little in a thread underneath his artwork:

<p></p>

I also learned that there has been research in this regard, trying to find sinusoidal formulas for approximating these hand movements and coincidentally this somehow comes very close to what Piter does in his sketch.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Huh, wow! No I hadn&#39;t seen that before, but it does look kind of similar!

<h2><a name='16'></a>#16 Reflection of a reflection</h2>

Reiterating on an idea from the previous year, by exploiting the property Perlin noise's mirrored-ness around the origin, one can obtain interesting <a href='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschachtest'>Rohrschach</a>-esque graphics by assigning the same stroke-width to the points that fall at the same spot in the four quadrants. Slightly displacing these points yields a faintly fuzzy texture:

<a href='https://twitter.com/sasj_nl'>Saskia Freeke</a>‚Äôs patterns were a big inspiration for this one, finding a couple of her sketches on pinterest, that had several dot patterns arranged on a grid, overlapping each other.

Similarly the irregular grid sketch for Genuary 3rd, the idea starts with a 2D array of boolean values that are initially all set to false. Then in a loop, we choose a rectangular patch of array entries with specific height and width, assign a colour to them and mark them as true. Here a truthy value signifies that these spots are occupied. Now, a cool thing happens when we try to mark a new patch, and it collides with an already existing patch of occupied entries. In this case we obtain a patch that is either missing a chunk or can not be assigned in its entirety.

In this manner we get a grid, with smaller grids inside of it that are intersecting and inside of each other. Drawing diagonal lines instead of dots on the array entries we can get some more interesting patterns as well.

<h2><a name='18'></a>#18 Definitely not a grid</h2>

Cheating a little bit now and then is also a big part of Genuary: to me this prompt had a bit of a sarcastic undertone, in as ‚ÄúWell, this definitely isn‚Äôt a grid? But maybe it is!‚Äù

I was a bit behind with the prompts at this point and went on Twitter to look for inspiration, and especially loved <a href='https://twitter.com/greweb'>Greweb</a>‚Äôs sketch that I think really fits the prompt. Using a different grid-like positioning strategy that is known as <b>Quinconce</b> positioning

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quinconce.

<p></p>

<a href='https://www.meubliz.com/definition/quinconce/'>This site</a> gives a good definition of Quinconce patterns, translated from French:

<blockquote>In art and decoration, Quinconce is given to arrangements that resemble a checkerboard pattern. These kinds of ornaments are placed in the four corners of a square and add a fifth additional element in the center. This repeated pattern has the advantage of producing a symmetrical and infinitely repeating motif</blockquote>

Essentially it is still a grid, but with every other row displaced by half of the width of the grid elements. I found a sort of hand drawn graphic that day, and wanted to recreate it by doing a little texture study. It became more of a pattern generator later on, drawing connections between the elements at random.

<h2><a name='19'></a>#19 Black and White</h2>

And again we‚Äôre cheating a little bit, technically any sketch can be disguised with black and white colors, but I wanted to sprinkle just a little bit of colour on top. Still messing around with the texture from before I combined it with the code from #16. Instead of drawing regular p5 points using the textured circular patches from before, with the occasionally coloured circles:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

After playing a bit more with the code I ended up with a sketch that I‚Äôm probably the most proud of this month:

<h2><a name='20'></a>#20 Art Deco</h2>

This one was a bit unimaginative to be fair, it‚Äôs a grid of some art-deco-esque patterns, adding a shadow with the rendering context and using transparent fills for a little bit of a glow effect. Personally I just don‚Äôt find the art-deco stuff very inspiring, maybe because it feels a bit lifeless to me.

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

<p></p>

It did lead to an interesting animation though, after my initial sketch I wasn‚Äôt satisfied and browsed Pinterest a bit more and wanted to make something a little less angular, ending up with the patterns you can see above on the right. The animated version of this sketch looked cool, and could have equally been a submission for the black and white prompt:

<h2><a name='21'></a>#21 Persian Rug</h2>

One of my biggest projects from last year was Exotic Quarpets, an sketch revolving around generative rugs:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
			<img class="viewable" src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/portfolio_jpg/Exotic Quarpet 1.jpg" alt="">

	</div>
</div>
<p></p>

Ideally, I would have reiterated on the project, but I remember it being a big and convoluted project. I dont't think that I could have elevated it or made any meaningful addition in one days time. I did however tackle the prompt in combination with #30 minimalism.

Persian rugs have really intricate patterns, and here I really liked <a href='https://twitter.com/theFoldster'>Foldster</a>'s very technical approach to generating these kinds of patterns:

<h2><a name='22'></a>#22 Shadows</h2>

I‚Äôve been ogling <a href='https://twitter.com/redblobgames'>Amit Patel</a>'s, aka redblobgames, <a href='https://www.redblobgames.com/articles/visibility/'>article on 2d visibility and ray casting</a> for a while now, and used the prompt as an excuse to code up the described ray casting algo. It was fairly easy, I was in the right headspace that day and already had already explored some line intersection code that I could reuse (thanks <a href='http://paulbourke.net/geometry/pointlineplane/'>Paul Bourke</a>).

Approaching it in an object oriented manner, it simply boiled down to creating a bunch of obstacles (polygons made out of lines) and then checking if the obstacles intersect with the rays of the caster (light source?):

<div class="image fit" style="display: block; margin: 0 0 0 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
  <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" style="width:100%; border-radius: 0.375em; margin: 0 0 0 0;" draggable="true">

  </video>
</div>
<p></p>

I wanted to see what it would look like with multiple light sources, which actually gave me a headache after a while. I had created a visual migraine. Coincidentally I came across Alexis Andre's Yayoi Kusama submission and sort of had a lightbulb moment:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="in" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary25?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#genuary25</a> Yayoi Kusama<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/generative?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#generative</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dailycoding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#dailycoding</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#genuary</a> <a href="https://t.co/rJp6u9IZPO">pic.twitter.com/rJp6u9IZPO</a></p>&mdash; Alexis Andr√© (@MacTuitui) <a href="https://twitter.com/MacTuitui/status/1618228324542877696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></p>

My ray casting code could easily be transformed into an animated Voronoi diagram with a simple modification. First, instead of drawing the rays as lines, we draw these lines as little dots, however still creating an illusion of a line. Then, for each one of these dots, we check its distance to all of the light sources, if the distance of a dot with respect to a light source that it doesn‚Äôt belong to is less than its distance towards its own light source, we simply don‚Äôt draw that dot. This is essentially just the basic definition of a Voronoi diagram, achieved in a backhanded manner, and we end up with something that looks as follows:

<h2><a name='23'></a>#23 More Moir√©</h2>

What‚Äôs better than one Moir√© pattern? More than one Moir√© pattern, duh!

A fairly simple sketch, a simple circle packing procedure that is run twice, filling two independent arrays with the positional information of the circles. These circles are then drawn to the canvas on top of each other and filled at random with two types of patterns: parallel lines or concentric circles. Making the circles sway back and forth slightly in a sinusoidal manner, accentuating the moir√© effect, but also causing it to be butchered by compression on social media. I found that making the strokes a little thicker helped with that just a tiny bit.

I think this sketch would look really cool on a huge screen, or projected onto the walls of a dark room for example. Could work well for an installation, with some atmospheric music playing in the background.

<h2><a name='24'></a>#24 Textile</h2>

Again I scoured Pinterest for inspiration because I had no idea what to make for this one, but came across some cool images searching for ‚Äòabstract textile‚Äô, here‚Äôs two that I particularly enjoyed:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">

<h2><a name='25'></a>#25 Yayoi Kusama</h2>

Generative art has also been a gateway for me to explore art history for myself. I especially love learning about specific artists' process, understanding where their art comes from and how they initially found their inspiration. Yayoi Kusama has a fascinating story:

<blockquote>One day I was looking at the red flower patterns of the tablecloth on a table, and when I looked up I saw the same pattern covering the ceiling, the windows, and the walls, and finally all over the room, my body and the universe. I felt as if I had begun to self-obliterate, to revolve in the infinity of endless time and the absoluteness of space, and be reduced to nothingness. As I realised it was actually happening and not just in my imagination, I was frightened. I knew I had to run away lest I should be deprived of my life by the spell of the red flowers. I ran desperately up the stairs. The steps below me began to fall apart and I fell down the stairs spraining my ankle.</blockquote>

Yayoi Kusama draws her very distinct style from this experience, trying to emulate the feeling of these feverish visions through her artworks. At first I wanted to create something in the style of her mushroom artworks:

<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
  <img class="viewable" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/87/23/27/872327cd9a9d44e05636643dd0b4daa7.jpg" alt="">
</span>
<p></p>

However it wouldn‚Äôt have been possible to do in one sitting, especially the quadilation (is that a word) pattern in the background. What kind of algorithm can emulate such a natural seeming pattern? A Delaunay triangulation where a common edge is removed from adjacent triangles? It definitely is something that I want to tackle at some point.

I ended up settling for the simpler dot pattern that occurs in most of her artworks:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
			<img class="viewable" src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/GENUARY2023/JPEGS/Genuary 25_1.jpg" alt="">

		</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p></p>

The special thing here is the slightly wobbly deformed circles, giving it a more hand drawn vibe. Tracing the circumference of the circles with many dots, and modulating their size with circular Perlin noise allows for a smooth and continuous deformation.

We already saw Alexis Andre's sketch, another cool one that day was by <a href='https://twitter.com/Yazid'>Yazid</a> who put his own spin on it with his recognizable style:

<h2><a name='26'></a>#26 My kid could have made that</h2>

What screams ‚Äúthis was made by a kid‚Äù more than something that is made with crayons? I leaned into that and redid a sketch back from early 2022 when I was sick and down with covid. It‚Äôs essentially also based on an irregular grid, where each rectangle is filled with scribbly hachure strokes giving it a little bit of a chaotic vibe:

The innovative thing here is that I didn‚Äôt use the rendering context‚Äôs clip method, but rather, for each one of the dots that make up the scribbly strokes I checked if they fill within the area of the rectangle. I fit falls outside, it is not drawn. That way the lines have smooth circular endpoints instead of being cutoff by the clip function.

<h2><a name='28'></a>#28 Generative Poetry</h2>

Generating meaningful sentences is a difficult task, and extensive research has already gone into this topic. At first I just printed random letters to the canvas to see if anything meaningful would come from it, but I just ended up with something that looked like a crossword puzzle. My second idea was forming random sentences from chaining random words, I found these two GitHub repos that had arrays of many <a href='https://github.com/rgbkrk/adjectives/blob/master/index.js'>adjectives</a> and <a href='https://gist.github.com/ijmacdowell/8325453'>adverbs</a>, and I was surprised to see that it kind of worked:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
			<img class="viewable" src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/GENUARY2023/JPEGS/Genuary 28_1.jpg" alt="">
		</span>
	</div>
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
			<img class="viewable" src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/GENUARY2023/JPEGS/Genuary 28_2.jpg" alt="">
		</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p></p>

I know that it‚Äôs just random combinations of words, but a lot of meaning can actually be read into the generated poems. Even though the sentences only consist of random adverbs and adjectives they end up being very expressive, and really emphasise certain moods. There is also something very rhythmic about this type of sentence.

That was the final form of the sketch, but I wonder what more can be done to control the generation process. One idea would be to somehow track the mood of the poem depending on the initially chosen words, somehow measure how positive or negative they are and then base subsequently chosen words on that, in an attempt to make the message of the generated poem a little bit more coherent. Another idea would be to generate sentences, not completely at random but with the help of a lexical tree (not exactly sure if that is what it‚Äôs called), basically choosing words based on previous words. At some point I also want to have a crack at making a context free grammar.

A favourite here was <a href='https://twitter.com/dominikus'>Dominikus'</a> attempt at finding hidden messages in a jumble of ad slogans:

<h2><a name='29'></a>#29 Maximalism</h2>

I browsed Pinterest for inspiration and found a lot of things related to interior design. One picture stood out to me, that had a cool checkerboard patterned floor and a sexy orange couch:

<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
  <img class="viewable" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/d8/8a/46/d88a463db4a988a9644606345f5282f9.jpg" alt="">
</span>
<p></p>

I wanted to somehow channel that aesthetic in form of a sketch, which turned out as a combination of outwardly expanding arcs and lots of alternating black and white textures:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
			<img class="viewable" src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/GENUARY2023/JPEGS/Genuary 30_1.jpg" alt="">
		</span>
	</div>
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">

		</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p></p>

These forms did feel a bit uninspired in the end and I reverted back to the circle packing code that I had already used for #25 and #27 but wanted to make it over the top and add as many patterns as I could fit.

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
			<img class="viewable" src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/GENUARY2023/JPEGS/Genuary 30_3.jpg" alt="">

		</span>
	</div>
</div>
<p></p>

The final state of the sketch then looked like this:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">

		</span>
	</div>

<p></p>

I enjoyed the interplay between slightly wobbly and strokless circles and the cleaner looker cartoony ones that had thick strokes, gives it a nice contrast. I also did some variations where there's two layers of circles, borrowing that idea from #23.

Reaching the final stretch we're still going strong, some cool ones for maximalism: spirograph flowers from <a href='https://twitter.com/emilyaweil'>Emily Weil</a>, a big mashup from <a href='https://twitter.com/Yazid'>Yazid</a> and a cool video based one from <a href='https://twitter.com/davepvm'>Dave</a>:

<h2><a name='30'></a>#30 Minimalism & #21 Persian Rug</h2>

I almost reused the code from #26 again as I was completely out of ideas, and even though there is some slight Perlin Noise being applied to the points that make up the central grid, it's quite subtle. Ultimately I ended up liking the minimal and playful aesthetic of these carpets, as if they were straight out of a children's book:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
	<div class="col-6">
		<span class="image fit" style="margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 0 0 0 0;">
			<img class="viewable" src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/GENUARY2023/JPEGS/Genuary 29_1.jpg" alt="">
		</span>
	</div>
	<div class="col-6">

		</span>
	</div>
</div>

A #TsubuyakiProcessing sketch is super on point for the minimalsim prompt, and Koma Tebe nails it with his sketch. I believe that it's the formula for a squircle where the curvature parameter is being interpolated:

<h2><a name='31'></a>#31 Remix a previous sketch</h2>

I also felt like I could skip this one as I had already remixed quite a few of the previous sketches, in addition to my brain being devoid of any new ideas as I had been catching up with 3 prompts a day at that point:

<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

And that's a wrap! So. Much. Generative. Art.

This took a while to put together, but is in no way an exhaustive list of sketches, just a round up of my personal favorites throughout the month. I probably missed quite a bunch of cool ones. If you want to explore more you can do so via the respective hashtags on Twitter, IG and Mastodon.

If you enjoyed going reading this, consider sharing it with on social media, with friends or family, dropping me a like and/or a follow on social media, or alternatively checking out some of my other posts form the past! Happy creative coding, sketching or time off from creative coding (I think we need a rest after Genuary)! Cheers!
