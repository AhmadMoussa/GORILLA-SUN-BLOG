<h2><a name='UI'>UI/UX Changes</a></h2>
Since it's launch, Hicetnunc.xyz has undergone a number of major UI changes. I will showcase some of them here, however this is not a tutorial, if you'd like to learn more about how to mint something on hicetnunc.xyz there already are a number of cool tutorials in different formats

<h2><a name='Presstube'>The 'Presstube' method</a></h2>
The 'Presstube' method is essentially a specific way of pricing NFTs on hicetnunc, which rewards the early birds that swoop in and cop the first couple of editions of a freshly minted NFT. When you mint an NFT on hicetnunc, it appears in the store, however it is not immediately up for sale.
