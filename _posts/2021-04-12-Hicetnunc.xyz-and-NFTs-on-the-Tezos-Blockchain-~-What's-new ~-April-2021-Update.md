<h2><a name='UI'>UI/UX Changes</a></h2>
Since it's launch, hicetnunc's UI has undergone a number of changes and revisions. The overall minting procedure is still pretty much the same as it was before, the biggest change being that there is no need to explicitely 'sync' before every action you do on the website. Once you connect your wallet and grant permission it'll stay synced with your wallet address, and it'll show it to in the top right corner next to the drop down 'hamburger' menu. The sync button still exists however, you simply click the drop down  menu in the top right corner, and where it previously showed your wallet address it'll show an 'unsync' button. Click it and it'll disconnect your current wallet address. 'unsync' becomes 'sync' and clicking the latter will ask you again to grant permission, now you can choose a different wallet address.

<p>Another major change is that you now get to preview your NFT before minting it. This conveniently allows you to check that everything is right before minting.</p>

<p>Additionally, note that the option for setting the royalties on your mints is now back. Royalties in this context basically mean that you'll get a percentage share of every subsequent sale of your NFTs. You can set this percentage between 10% and 25%.</p>

<p>After hitting the preview button, you'll have the option to go back to fix any of the NFT details.</p>

<p>If everything seems alright, then you can hit the 'mint' to finalize the mint.</p>

<p>If you messed up anything, or just want to delete an NFT you've previously created, you now have the option to burn NFTs. Burning essentially means, that you'll send the NFT to a burner address that isn't owned by anyone (This is how I understand it). All of this costs almost nothing due to the cheap Tezos Gas Fees!</p>

<p>If you're still confused about how to mint NFTs on hicetnunc.xyz then this Video series should clear up all remaining uncertainties:</p>

<h2><a name='Secondary'>The Secondary Market</a></h2>
<p>You can now not only collect, but also re-sell previously acquired OBJKTs in your collection! This feature was rolled out quietly throughout the month an had some issues at first. The UI worked in such a manner that if someone were to offer up an NFT for sale that they've collected, while the original creator still had remaining editions of said NFT up for sale, they would essentially supersede the original creator with their offer, since the 'click to collect' button would have to be shared. This was problematic, because if someone were to re-sell 1 edition of an NFT for 100tez, when the original creator still had dozens of the same NFT up for sale at a much lower price, these would then essentially be blocked until someone bought the NFT offered for 100tez.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some people might not have realized it yet: the secondary market on <a href="https://twitter.com/hicetnunc2000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hicetnunc2000</a> is open now.<br><br>Yes, you can sell any NFT you collected. The only problem is that the UI has not noticed that yet.<br><br>So if the first number before the &quot;/&quot; is &gt; 0, try clicking &quot;not for sale&quot;. <a href="https://t.co/lY9pr6UsvU">pic.twitter.com/lY9pr6UsvU</a></p>&mdash; Mario Klingemann (@quasimondo) <a href="https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/1376098068425289730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></p>
<p>This button introduced another problem, that caused a number of users quite the frustration. If an NFT were to sell all of it's remaining editions, the button would show 'not for sale'. This, however, didn't mean that the button was not able to be clicked. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, i&#39;ll wait a bit before swapping, I just gave 20tez to someone who took 31 of my early freebies</p>&mdash; Patrick Tresset etc. (@patricktresset) <a href="https://twitter.com/patricktresset/status/1376163365312200706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></p>
<p>This has now been fixed by showing all open offers for an NFT in it's collectors tab, with the respective price and the wallet address of the seller.  </p>

<p>Lessons learned, always check the price befor hitting the confirm button in your wallet!</p>

<h2><a href='Templates'>HTML/P5JS/and other upload Templates</a></h2>
<p>What first started as html encapsulated in an svg file, has become another avant garde feature of hicetnunc. Data formats such as html, svg, p5js, pdf are now supported by hicetnunc and can be minted as NFTs. This was pioneered by a number of Twitter users in parallel, a super insightiful article by Twitter user @tarwin can be found <a href='https://tarwin.medium.com/hit-et-nunc-advanced-svg-nfts-a6040262f4d5'>here</a>.  You can find the respective templates for each supported format <a href='https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/tree/main/templates'>here</a>. You'll have to replace certain parts of the templates with your own code, replace the default thumbnail.png / thumbnail.gif with your own and zip all files. This zip file will be what you upload at mint time. Amazing Right?</p>

<p>And here's an example of what a minted interactive p5js sketch looks like. Go ahead and hover over the NFT:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/27560" width="100%" height="1000"></iframe>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe the next cool thing could be a convenient and customizable iframe embed code? That could allow creators to display and sell their creations easily from their own website.</p>

<h2><a name='OBJKT4OBJKT'>OBJKT4OBJKT</a></h2>
<p>On the weekend of the 26th of March, in celebration of 10k minted NFTs on hicetnunc, we've seen an event started by Twitter duo @ameliemaiaa and @tataismo1 that go under the handle @DiverseNftArt, that encouraged users to share NFTs for free under the hastag #OBJKT4OBJKT, such that users on hicetnunc could build up their collections without a cost. Even though the event is officially over, searching the hashtag #OBJKT4OBJKT on Twitter, you'll probably still be able to find some free NFT goodies. It is also very likely that this event will make a return in the future.</p>

<h2><a name='Copyminters'>Copyminters and Hoarders</a></h2>
<p>A problem that arose with the OBJKT4OBJKT event was that some individuals would collect multiples of certain free OBJKTs, while not being illegal, it is clearly a dick move. The main purpose being the later resale of the claimed NFTs.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just realized that one of the guys shamelessly snatching dozens of copies of the free <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OBJKT4OBJKT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OBJKT4OBJKT</a> pieces was @sirboomcat aka tz1MHVtpYFsW7VDH1rhbhK3Krad14n6Ww8RD.<br><br>The hint is his own NFT, <a href="https://t.co/pZCSOvGdPg">https://t.co/pZCSOvGdPg</a>, which he minted for this reply here: <a href="https://t.co/UQOmiyxl5o">https://t.co/UQOmiyxl5o</a><br><br>1/2 <a href="https://t.co/DsEBrBLSA2">pic.twitter.com/DsEBrBLSA2</a></p>&mdash; Django BRRRRiÍú© üåÆ (@djangobits) <a href="https://twitter.com/djangobits/status/1376278372712595464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p></p>

<p>Copyminting is another huge issue, where someone mints an NFT/piece/artwork that is not originally theirs. Some solutions to this problem are being discussed in<a href='https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/issues/433'>this</a> github issue started byt Twitter user @quasimondo. He proposes a community regulated system that revolves around a 'trust' metric, which will be attributed to each wallet address active on the platform. The main point being that new wallet addresses will have to accrue some trust before they can freely mint on hicetnunc. Here's a short excerpt, but I also recommend reading up on it:</p>

<blockquote>
One common feature of copyminters is that they usually get caught very quickly already by the volunteers who observe newly minted works and double check those that look suspicious. This means that the offending wallets usually get banned within hours from the platform. This also means that the copyminters have to create a new wallet and start again, with no public "trust" in the form of likes or their works sold showing up in trusted collectors' collections.

This is why I believe that we have to address this problem at the root - which is by preventing those first sales to be successful. A mechanism I have in mind for that is to use an escrow smart contract that acts a proxy for all sales by minters who have no sales history yet and who have not yet built up a network of trust.
</blockquote>

<h2><a href='hDAO'>hDAO and the hDAO feed</a></h2>
<p>You might've noticed already that every NFT on hicetnunc has a little circle underneath it, in the lower right corner. The same circle can be found on the NFT page itself, underneath the OBJKT number, and also in the drop down menu. This circle isn't just some aesthetical UI fluff but it can actually be clicked. Clicking it underneath an NFT will trigger your Tezos wallet, clicking it in the hamburger menu takes you to the hDAO feed.</p>

<span class="image fit"><img src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/2021-04-12-Hicetnunc.xyz-and-NFTs-on-the-Tezos-Blockchain-~-What's-new ~-April-2021-Update/hdao_underneath_NFT.png" alt="" /></span>

<p>When you click the circle underneath an NFT or from it's dedicated page, it'll trigger your wallet which will allow you to spend some of your hDAO tokens on the NFT. I'm not entirely sure what the tokens are or how they work, but once spent they essentially work as an upvote for the NFT. If someone knowledgeable would like to chime in on this, be my guest!</p>

<span class="image fit"><img src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/2021-04-12-Hicetnunc.xyz-and-NFTs-on-the-Tezos-Blockchain-~-What's-new ~-April-2021-Update/hdao_feed.png" alt="" /></span>

I'm not certain how many people are aware of the hDAO as of now, or if they're actually using it to search for potential purchases. This also brings up the issue of creators upvoting their own creations with their hDAO tokens, esentially boosting and skewing the rankings in their favor (if/when the hDAO feed becomes a more integral part of hicetnunc).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So what exactly are hDAO tokens on hicetnunc?

<h2><a name='Kalamint'>A new challenger arrives: Kalamint ~ Punc vs. Boutique</a></h2>
<p>Kalamint was officially announced on the 19th of December as the 'first NFT marketplace on Tezos', and was scheduled for a release in January 2021. This release was then delayed to the 18th of February, which was delayed again due to some UI problems and Kalamint didn't launch until the 23rd of March. At this point it might be a little bit silly to still call it the 'first NFT platform for Tezos', when hicetnunc had already been up and running for more than a month. Not complaining though, the more the merrier, and maybe this competition will drive both platforms to keep improving.<p>

<p>Kalamint is vastly differently from hicetnunc, being described as a boutique NFT store vs. the spartanic hicetnunc (as described by some members of the community). One thing that I actually like about Kalamint is that they verify the creators before allowing them to mint and list NFTs, this somewhat circumvents the copyminting issue but could also be regarded as gatekeeping, as they have full control of what is being minted on their platform. But maybe they're intended to cater to different audiences, hicetnunc being much more accessible to people who just want to dip their toes into the Tezos NFT waters. </p>

<p>In other news, Opensea has also <a href='https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/tezos-nfts-are-coming-to-opensea/'>announced</a> the support of Tezos NFTs, however there hasn't been a clear ETA. Speculatively later this month or early next month. Meanwhile, other NFT platforms are being developed such as <a href='https://twitter.com/tezauction'>tezauction</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/BazaarNfts'>BazaarNFTs</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/DAuctionHouse'>DAuctionHouse</a>, which are worth checking out.

<h2><a name='Presstube'>Pricing things adequately and the 'Presstube' method</a></h2>
It's still not very clear to creators how to number editions and price their NFTs adequately, and what combinations thereof will help them maximising sales. After experimenting, some hicetnunc users have come up with creative strategies for selling their NFTs, one of them being the 'Presstube' method.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I didn‚Äôt coin it so it‚Äôs marginally embarrassing every time I see it called that üòù but...<br><br>The practice of pricing editions so that they begin accessible (even sometimes free) and then the price steps up as editions sell<br><br>Jury‚Äôs still out on whether it‚Äôs a good idea though!

The 'Presstube' method is essentially a specific way of pricing NFTs on hicetnunc, which rewards the early birds that swoop in and cop the first couple of editions of a freshly minted NFT. It's possible due to how the hicetnunc UI works. When you mint an NFT on hicetnunc, it appears in the feed and your creations tab, however it is not immediately up for sale. You still have to specify how many editions you want put up for sale. In that manner, you can sell different amounts for different prices.
