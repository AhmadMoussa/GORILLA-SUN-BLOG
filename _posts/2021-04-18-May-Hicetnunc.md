Another update from me on everything hicetnunc and tezos in the past couple of weeks since my last post. Time in crypto space sure goes by fast, and many things might have flewn under your radar, hence I've tried my best again at scouring Twitter to piece together all the details:

1. <a href='#Galleries'>Galleries</a>
2. <a href='#Community'>Community</a>
3. <a href='#hDAO'>hDAO developments, new functions and other tokens</a>
4. <a href='#OBJKT4OBJKT2'>OBJKT4OBJKT2</a>

6. <a href='#Tezos'>Tezos</a>


<h2><a name='Galleries'>Galleries and the FEN</a></h2>

“The FEN” is a series of coordinated CryptoArt drops to encourage artists and collectors to transition their NFTs to a low-energy consumption blockchain. 

Joannie Lemercier and Juliette explain that the motivation behind #theFEN is twofold: at it's core it is an innitiative to transition art galleries and exhibitions to a digital venue, many of which had to be cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic, and secondly it is an attempt at converting and bringing over artists, that haven't necessarily been involved with the crypto space, to join HEN.

Very recently and probably most known to the crypto space through his article on the impact of PoW blockchains on the environment Memo Akten aka  has also joined #theFEN

I was honestly delighted to see Dave White aka @beesandbombs and Zach Lieberman also join hicetnunc, both of them being big influences on me to pick up creative coding.

<h2><a name='Community'>Community Stats</a></h2>
The hicetnunc community is ever growing

At this pace, we&#39;re just weeks away from it becoming the leading NFT marketplace; not just the leading NFT marketplace on Tezos, but the leading NFT marketplace period! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tezos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Tezos</a> <a href="https://t.co/Y972TrUYc7">pic.twitter.com/Y972TrUYc7</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Mehrabi (@KMehrabi) <a href="https://twitter.com/KMehrabi/status/1382933163014455296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2><a name='hDAO'>hDAO, the hottest Tezos token</a></h2>
At the time of writing, hDAO is arguably the most valuable Tezos governance token, it is however still hazy as to what it's ultimate function will be. You might even have some hDAO tied to your wallet address, if you've been active on hicetnunc in the first 40 days of it's launch and have successfully completed a purchase or sold some NFTs for some amount of xtz. During that period an equal amount of hDAO was awarded to the seller and purchaser of the transaction depending on the amount of xtz involved in the transaction, say you collected an NFT from someone for 1tez, then each of you would have received 0.5 hDAO. After this initial 40 day period no more hDAO was handed out and it's total supply is limited to 650 000.

What is a governance token?

There are several ways to check how much hDAO you currently hold: your temple wallet, your hicetnunc profile or on quipuswap.

In my previous post, I talked a little about the hDAO feed and it's upvoting functionality, however it seems that hDAO will have a much larger purpose in the coming weeks
